So this is my first blog entry. It's a rainy day in Melbourne and I have used the downtime to set this blog up.

Truth be told I'll probably take this entry down soon. It's just helping me get set up.

For now I'll leave you with this. A source in the Australian government has leaked information ('Sup ASIO. How's your daughter?) about a government program to train an army of super squirrels that will infiltrate parks Australia wide and use deadly force against puppet uprisings (especially those puppets with nuts). Take heed my fellow Australians.

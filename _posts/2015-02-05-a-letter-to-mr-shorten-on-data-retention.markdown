Here is a letter I just wrote to Bill Shorten on why he and the shadow cabinet
need to throw out the data retention bill once it surfaces in the lower house.

Now I know he isn't really the man primarily involved in this but he does
play a figurehead role in getting this bill over the line.

Feel free to plagiarise as much as you like and please write or call a minister.

If you want this bill quashed and have a few minutes to snap some words together,
Scott Ludlam has [some people you can engage right here](http://scott-ludlam.greensmps.org.au/call-labor-senator-stop-data-retention).

Enjoy!

Dear Minister Shorten,

I am writing to you in regard to the metadata retention legislation that is soon to be debated in the lower house.

I'm going to be frank; most Australians and most our politicians don't really understand computers, networks or IT in general. Maybe it's a symptom of being the "lucky country". Most wouldn't know the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. Most find it hard to understand the issues and magnitude of the PRISM revelations and yet more are oblivious to the increasing impact technology will have on their lives today let alone in the next five plus years.

This proposed bill takes full advantage of this ignorance the average Australian has toward these issues and trust we enshrine in our political system. To me it is incumbent on all politicians to understand to the best of their abilities the major issues in any legislation they are passing. However I think this legislation of this much significance deserves more ardent scrutiny.

I find it abysmal that Senator Scott Ludlum has been the only discernible voice of resistance on this topic. While the government constantly downplays and contrasts this bill to similar yet not exact laws in Europe, one would only expect gay marriage, high speed internet, better welfare etc. to be tabled with the same vigour. I also find it bizarre that such little thought to the impact this has on  Australian business as most companies will likely move or start their data operations in countries without such Orwellian regulations. Just what we need, further removal of economic productivity.

What I am asking you as an all around nice guy who capable of way better zingers than KFC (did you like that one? You can keep that!) and leader of the opposition is to demand the following. I sincerely hope you resist siding with he government on this bill until:

- an explicit definition of “metadata" and “content” is included in the Data Retention legislation
- the 2 year retention period is reexamined considering the very few requests that exceed 6 months.
- it is confirmed that access to data be limited to serious crime
- an oversight mechanism be established for the warrant approval process
- it is confirmed that individuals be notified when their metadata is accessed, and that an avenue exist to challenge that access is provided.

Australia’s law enforcement agencies are already filing 500,000 requests a year for warrantless access to metadata, and are more than capable of tackling serious crime with their existing powers. Why is this further invasion of privacy required?

Setting aside the civil liberties argument I leave you with one my my favourite quotes from the political scientist and historian Michael Parenti:

>“The worst forms of tyranny, or certainly the most successful ones, are not those we rail against but those that so insinuate themselves into the imagery of our consciousness, and the fabric of our lives, as not to be perceived as tyranny.”


Yours faithfully,


Mark Angrish

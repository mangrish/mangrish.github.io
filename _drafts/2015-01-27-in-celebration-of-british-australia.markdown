We have to demand changes to media and advertising representation of what our
identity is.


Subtitle: Australia has been without an identity for the last 40 years. It's time
to forge one.

If you met Australia in the 1970's it would probably have been a man. He would have been white,
in his late teens with really rich parents. Australia would have been a
captivating figure; at a party he would be that person everyone wants to know.
He would be tall, rugged, handsome and tanned. He would have a bright smile that
beams warmth and a cheeky twinkle in his eye that from afar could seem like fun.
With his weird sayings and laissez faire attitude to life it was hard to not like him.

This is the Australia we exported the world then. No blacks, no browns, no yellows.
A peachy white British enclave in the South Pacific.

Australia then took two major steps which would tear it's very identity apart. In 1967,
having just recognised Indigenous Australians as human beings a decade earlier, Australia took an even bigger step and
gave them the right to vote. Then in 1973 the Whitlam government (on the back of major reforms by Holt)
completed the dismantling of the White Australia policy allowing non white people to
immigrate to Australia.

Fourty-two years on and with an ever increasing ethnic diversity Australia still
clings on to it's 1970's identity.

##Our first identity: Black Australia

For over 50,000 years or 2000 generations Australia was uniquely black. It had
a soul: a rich and diverse culture built on a long oral tradition. The
indigenous way of life was symbiotic with the breathing earth. Their connection
to the land went deeper than anything the British could ever understand.
It's only ironic in todays day and age that our biggest cause for
concern is rationalising our connection to the environment to tackle climate
change. These people were practising it for millennia.

For 50,000 years the face of Australia was black.

Their history changed on the 26th January 1788. As Arthur Phillip descended on to
Sydney Cove and claimed New South Wales for the crown, he marked day in infamy for
Indigenous Australia. This is the day Their land, Their home was invaded and
illegally taken from Them. To this day Australia remains the only country in the
world to not have a Treaty with their indigenous inhabitants.

Indigenous Australians fought bravely for 50 years to push back the British
invasion of their countries. In the end, their strength and resistance diminished
from European disease and native police dropped their numbers from an estimated
750,000 to 1 million inhabitants in 1788 to around 60,000 "full blooded"
Aboriginals by 1933. All but a handful of the Aborigines in the island state of Tasmania
had been eradicated. My home state of Victoria had less than 90.

Australia began to practise more inhumane and what can only be described as
cold blooded acts to control it's British
Australia was admired for it's versions of slavery and suppression of the black
population. South Africa would base it's Apartheid laws on the state of Queensland's
Aboriginal Protection Act (1897). Australian law made it legal to kidnap indigenous
children and place them in white families. Until 1967 Aboriginal people were
considered native fauna: that is they were thought of as subhuman. aboriginal deaths in custordy.

British Australians have only been in Australia for 6-9 generations. That is less
than 0.45% of the total time Aboriginal people have lived here.

Point: Multiculturalism

Point: First attempt at identity: Keating

Point: Reversal: Howard and the rise of Nationalism

Point: Australia Day: A celebration of white Australia

Point: The search for a soul

Point: A new national holiday during school term recognising the first Australians.

Point: Begin the process of creating a Treaty between the first people's and the commonwealth

Point: Mark the day that consensus is reached as the new Australia day.

Point: This will take time. Do your part every year.

Conclusion: Australian identity is inherently Aboriginal. White Australia was
an abberation and our identity is multicultural. It's time to pledge allegiance
to ourselves and not a country or flag.

In perhaps a fitting insight into what the world has become I hope this quote from
my favourite book will endure:
"If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures
similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed
world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on
which his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however
often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be
crossed by anything except bombs."

 Whilst scanning some events to attend in Melbourne to alleviate my loneliness (I am in a home office by myself.. i'm not sure I even remember how to speak anymore!) i came across this: [Melbourne Silicon Beach event](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Silicon-Beach/events/218612554/). It's for non tech people and is basically a pitching event by General Assembly. My comment for the event was too long so i've reproduced it here instead.

>"I don't want to come across as negative as I am quite pro non tech people in tech but I really don’t get the point of this type of meetup. GA have a good rep at what they do: injecting non tech people with enough skill to put together a simple web product or prototype. Some even take to it and get jobs as entry level programmers. Look, people learning to code is great and has [been talked about to death](http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/) so I’m not getting into that. 
>
>What I would rather share with people who are not willing to drop everything and start a new career or get obsessed with programming but are perhaps excited by the start up field is to go hunting for a startup with some runway and show off whatever it is you do. revolutionise sales, overhaul the product feature pipeline, change the business strategy etc. IMHO non tech people are of an enormous value after a core tech founder team is formed. Joining as a late stage founder or early employee can be just as awesome. To use their talents trying to code feels like a waste of time.

>If you really want to do your own idea now (like now, now) then you should learn the principles of good UX and product development strategies and perhaps some UI design over coding as that will be way more important in incrementing your ideas (this is where sketch or photoshop skill really helps). Alternatively if that's not for you, joining an existing startup could help you even farther. There you can build relationships with tech and non tech people, in and out of the company and then once you have the right rapport and relationships, you can execute on an idea and be several orders of magnitude more effective than you could have been by trying to code.

>That said, if you truly do want to change career or have the spare time or money to learn to code, doing one of these bootcamps can be pretty beneficial as a baseline for entering the tech industry.
>
>Like I said I don't want to be negative, I just think pitching this as advice for non tech people as a vehicle to look at what GA are doing isn't the right message from my perspective. I hope this has helped someone anyway. OK, procrastination over, time for a coffee!"

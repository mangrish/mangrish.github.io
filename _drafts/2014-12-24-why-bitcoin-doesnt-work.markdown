I'm pretty over Bitcoin. I was never a huge advocate to start with but I am really
just over this being a "thing".

For me, like so many things in technology; it's a cool solution begging for a real problem.



# The old money angle.. some quick history

OK so is Bitcoin money or not? What exactly is money anyway? Some
reasonable googling will tell you what money is but in order to know what money is
temporally we need to understand where it came from. You can probably google the
history of money elsewhere but if you want the ridiculously oversimplified version here it is:

If you believe Adam Smith people have always bartered and when civilisations sprung up
in ancient times they needed
 a way to exchange stuff of perceived unequal value. For example, say I'm a cattle farmer
 and I want a few eggs this morning. I know you have chickens so we begin to talk about
 trading. Now, I can't give you a whole cow for say a limited shelf life of hundreds of
 eggs and I don't want to kill my cow and give you a piece for some eggs and I don't
 want several chickens either and .. oh you get the idea.. bartering sucked. So geniuses
  came up with money.


First, people used commodities like gold and silver and even things like grain.
These commodities worked pretty well, in fact they worked for an insanely long time till
commercial banking came along and bank notes with it. Now rather than hording the gold under your bed you could throw it in these new fandangled banks. In turn for leaving your
gold with them they would give you a bunch of promisary notes or IOU's or what we know
today as bank notes, which just said something like "whoever has this note can take back about this much
gold from a branch of this bank". Remember that line for when I get to bitcoin. It's going to be important.

In 1971 the US changed it's stance on using gold to back it's IOU's. Instead it said
gold would no longer be redeemable and in fact all you get is the word of the United
States government that $5 is worth $5. What really was happening is that some
geniuses worked out that the reason why people were freely passing money between each
other for goods and services was less about the real gold in the banks and more about
the trust in the overall system that oversaw the banks. Psychologically it was this
very trust that kept the whole financial system running. And that system was a complex
web of the government, the reserve and commercial banking systems.

The entered the whole world into a new form of banking; the one we have today.
Countries would now hold reserves of other currencies rather than gold (but mostly US$). The web just got a lot bigger. Now you had a system where countries governments and
reserve banking system were all tied to each other.

Time for bitcoin to pwn the world right?

# The characteristics of money
Let’s have a quick recap on what money is; here is what money must do for it to work:

It must be a:
1. Medium of exchange: a way to trade goods and services without having to barter.
1. Unit of account: a standard measurement for goods, services and any assets you have.
1. Store of value: a predictable way to store and retrieve value.

The three systems I explained earlier all check the boxes as long as everyone and
I mean everyone believes in the system.

# Enter the Bitcoin: Why bitcoin just sucks

Let's look at bitcoin in isolation. Can it function as money? Medium of exchange: Check.
Unit of account: errr.. sort of. Store of value: I'm going to flat out say no.

Now you might be saying. "Well fine. When everyone eventually believes in Bitcoin it will
totally work". And that would be wrong as well. In my oversimplification of the three
systems I didn't mention some stuff.

OK, so bitcoin is off to a pretty shaky start in that it doesn’t check all the boxes to be classified as money.

Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. That's right, the most amount of bitcoin that can ever be minted is 21 million. At the time of writing it's at about 13.7 million. That means bitcoin is deflationary. In terms of supply and demand, eventually there is only 21 million units chasing around an infinite (if you are a true capitalist, finite if you believe in sustainability!) amount of resources. Thinking that through means as more
and more people start using bitcoin, the value of each bitcoin is perceived to be worth
more and more. This is awesome if you are taking a ridiculously long position on bitcoin.
The economic signal being sent to the market is this: if you stop spending your bitcoins
but instead horde them you will get a bigger payout as more people join. Or to put it another way: as more people enter into a fixed amount of currency, those who are there earlier and hold more of it are inclined to keep holding it rather than spending it to rake in the bucks.

As a country's treasury, this would be the worst thing that you would want. Spending is what keeps
the capitalism game rolling. The more you spend the greater wealth is being pushed
through the economy. You want to get the right ratio.. save a little and spend a reasonable amount. if you get that mix wrong you either end up with hyper inflation or
deflation and a plaque on the desk of your treasury department congratulating you
on setting back your country 50 years.


# what would need to happen to get this to remotely work

Bitcoin wallets tied to real identities - go governments can collect tax
No cap on total coins - so the status quo can retain their value



# What bitcoin really is

Bitcoin is more of a failed socio-political statement towards a crypto anarcheac type
of money system.

In the end I feel the community has failed to understand that this is, and never has
been a technical problem.

That's not to say that the bitcoin experiment wasn't worth it. It's made us look critically at the instituions that control the flow of money. The same systems
that gave us too big to fail and the GFC. It's helped us see that there is something
wrong and it needs fixing.

In the end I don't think Bitcoin will make it. Unless the government tax departments
get in on the blockchain, I just can't see it being supported.



If there was a political revolution to go with it we might have
 something of substance to talk about but for the most part it's just a pump and dump some rich old libertarian white men want to hookwink people with.



 Even if you can coerce bitcoin to fulfill the function of money you then have another battle to deal with those guys.. and yeah and: the government

# Bonds, federal reserves and the tax man

 You then get into the situation where the government needs to gaurentee savings.

 Even if you can coerce governments into accepting bitcoin, you then have another battle to deal with: the status quo

 I think it’s also fascinating that


 Right now richville looks like this:
 Bill Gates
 Carlos Slim etc.

 And if a bitcoin world was preferred (and complete collapse of the world financial markets occurred and most existing rich dudes in the status quo kept a lot of liquidity in cash) this rich list kinda looks like this:
 Cameron and Typer Winklevoss, Tim Draper etc.

 Without descending into any illuminati or NWO type stuff, I’m pretty sure the guys in the first list would do everything in their power to hold on to that stature.

 OK fine.. bitcoin isn’t ready to be money but dude.. the mah’fkn’ blockchain!

 Ah the blockchain.  If you are a nerd or even better a crypto nerd you are just losing your shit at how cool this thing is. As you can see from the bitcoin rich list, there are no names attached to the accounts. The only real demand for the blockchain is drummed by by these guys:

 Just don’t try and return your purchase. You will break the internet.

 You also need a key to access your wallet.. (rubbish tip lost 7.5M)

 Tax man

 Oh.. you paid Johnny BTC0.0032 for goods.. awesome! Tax please.. oh it was a service? Tax please! Illegal? Tax please..plus have some jail.

 BTC enthusiasts think that every actor is rational.. always.. and the truth is we arent’. Marketing in grocery stores or giving someone a new credit card and sending them into a shopping mall shows we aren’t always rational.

 # Conclusion
 Fine.. you’ve made me hate bitcoin.. and I hate you you technology hater

 No wait! BTC is doing one thing so awesomely that it will hopefully start to change the way FX happens for non-institutional customers. You can shift money between currencies for the fraction of the price of a broker if you can do the transactions fairly swiftly.


 Perhaps this is part of a bigger problem that I hope to explore of the coming months. And that is the drive of bitcoin and many other questionable products (uber, etc.) is coming from venture capitalism.. but venture capitalism at it’s worst. These guys are investing in terrible ideas, not unlike the dot com and hoping to sell it on before anyone can really do the due diligence. If tranches of collatoralised debt obligations in financial markets were making people scratch their heads.. how about building on that and getting people to not understand further intangibles like software engineering.

 We should also be aware that humans have a history and a knack for subverting rules and systems for power or greed. Just like wall st. finds ways to make money from laws that are meant to control them so will people find novel ways to get stuff for free.


 So perhaps it’s worth revisiting what bitcoin is really trying to solve. Is it really trying to create a decentralized money system? For me bitcoin is as much socio political as it is technological.


 We programmers are infamous for creating solutions and then trying to wedge them into problems that just aren’t there (SV calls this ‘product market fit’). You can’t create a money system without political buy in. You can’t separate these entities.

 No government in their right mind is going to support anonymous accounts.. ever. Rather than building things that make things fairer in the world it just seems to me that bitcoin wants to supplant one rich list with another.

 There is a future for currency and it will probably be digital. bitcoin just isn’t it.
